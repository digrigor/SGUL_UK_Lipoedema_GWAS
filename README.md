# SGUL_UK_Lipoedema_GWAS
Scripts used to analyse UK Lipoedema GWAS

- Discovery study:
Scripts used to analyse the GWAS data for the 148 Lipoedema patients vs 5000+ Undestanding Society Controls

- Replication study:
Scripts used within the Genomics England Research Environment to perform the replication of the 30 top variants of the discovery study in 27 GEL pariticpants vs 10,000+ controls.

For both Discovery and Replication studies the whole analysis directory format is included in this repository but because data is not avaiable at the moment, all genotyping data and files with participant IDs have not been included.
